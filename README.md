## üß≠ Overview

This repository contains my **IBM Data Science Capstone Project**, completed as the final requirement for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  

The project simulates a real-world scenario where a fictional competitor, **Space Y**, seeks to estimate SpaceX launch costs by predicting whether Falcon 9 first-stage boosters will successfully land.  
To achieve this, I built an **end-to-end data pipeline** ‚Äî from **data collection and wrangling** through **exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning** ‚Äî to predict booster recovery outcomes.

---

## üìä Executive Summary

We achieved an **83.34% prediction accuracy** using classification models built on SpaceX launch data.  
Key findings from the analysis include:

- Booster recovery success can be accurately predicted using features like **Flight Number**, **Orbit**, **Launch Site**, **Payload Mass**, and **Booster Version**.  
- The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model demonstrated the best generalization and minimal overfitting.  
- **Interactive dashboards** and **geographic visualizations** revealed additional insights:
  - All launch sites are located **on the coast** and near **transportation infrastructure**.
  - **Kennedy Space Center (KSC)** produced the **most successful recoveries**.
  - Payloads between **3,000‚Äì4,000 kg** achieved the **highest success rates**.

## üß© Project Workflow

### **1. Data Collection**
- Collected launch data using the **[SpaceX REST API](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)**.  
- Supplemented data via **web-scraping Wikipedia** using *BeautifulSoup* ([Notebook Link](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb)).

### **2. Data Wrangling**
- Cleaned and transformed data with **SQLite** and **Pandas**.  
- Created a categorical target variable indicating booster landing success.  
- [Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/labs-jupyter-spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb)

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted SQL-based insights and statistical exploration ([SQL Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite%20(1).ipynb)).  
- Visualized trends and feature relationships using **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Folium**.  
- [EDA Visualization Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/edadataviz.ipynb)

### **4. Interactive Visualizations**
- Built **Folium maps** to explore launch-site geographies and success/failure clusters.  
  - [Folium Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location%20(1).ipynb)
- Created a **Plotly Dash dashboard** for interactive payload and success analysis.  
  - [Dashboard Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/spacex_dash_app_py.ipynb)

### **5. Predictive Modeling**
Trained and compared **four supervised classification models** to predict booster landing success:

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Logistic Regression | 83.34 % | Solid baseline model |
| Support Vector Machine | 83.34 % | Balanced and stable |
| Decision Tree | 100 % (train), 66 % (test) | Overfit |
| **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** | **83.34 %** | Best generalization |

- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**  
- Evaluation via **accuracy scores** and **confusion matrices**  
- [Machine Learning Notebook](https://github.com/agcunning25-byte/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb)

## üìà Results

- **Final Model:** KNN Classifier (83.34 % accuracy)  
- **Key Insights:**
  - Orbit types **GEO**, **HEO**, and **SSO** exhibit near-perfect success rates.  
  - Higher payloads tend to correlate with increased success probability.  
  - Coastal launch sites near railways and highways display better recovery outcomes.

---

## üß† Conclusions & Next Steps

Although current SpaceX success rates are similar to the model‚Äôs predicted accuracy, further optimization could include:

- Applying **stratified sampling** for balanced train/test splits.  
- Introducing **class weights** to handle imbalanced outcomes.  
- Performing deeper hyperparameter tuning on the **Decision Tree** model, which showed strong training accuracy.  

These improvements would enhance recall and reduce false negatives in future iterations.
